## AYA BACKEND TASK 2 (Develop an improved Task Management)

A to-do list is important for time management because it helps to prioritize tasks and stay organized. By clearly outlining the tasks that need to be completed, a to-do list allows for a better allocation of time and resources. It also helps to prevent procrastination and keep on track toward meeting goals.

A productivity expert David Allen said: "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." A to-do list allows you to capture ideas and tasks as they come to mind and then organize and prioritize them, rather than trying to hold onto them in your mind and risk forgetting something important.

Your task is to Develop a REST API for a to-do list application

involves several steps:

1. Define the API endpoint: Identify the various resources that need to be accessed by the API such as tasks, users, labels, and endpoints to access them.
2. Design the API: Use a standard like JSON API to define the request and response format.
3. Implement the API: Use a web framework Express.js (Node.js) to implement the API endpoints and handle the requests and responses.
4. Implement database: Use MongoDB to store and retrieve the data for the tasks and user information.
5. Implement security: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
6. Test the API: Test the API by sending requests to the endpoints and validating the responses.
7. Deploy the API: Deploy the API to a production environment so that you can consume the API

### some functional requirements that should be considered include:
- User management: the ability for users to create and manage their own accounts, with functionality such as registration, login, and password recovery.
- Task management: the ability for users to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as organize them into different categories or lists.
- Notifications(In-App): the ability for users to receive notifications about upcoming deadlines for tasks, or when tasks are completed.
- Data storage: the ability to store and retrieve data for tasks and user information, and ensure data security and privacy.
- API: the ability to provide an API for the front end of the application to interact with the backend and retrieve or update data.
- Scalability: the ability to handle an increasing number of users and tasks without a significant decrease in performance.
- Reporting: the ability to create reports on the progress of tasks, such as how many tasks are completed, how much time is spent on tasks, etc.
- Integration: The ability to integrate with other applications such as calendar, email, etc.

### Non-functional requirements
- Performance: the ability for the system to handle a large number of requests and perform tasks quickly, without significant delays or lag.
- Reliability: the ability for the system to be available and function correctly at all times, with minimal downtime or errors.
- Maintainability: the ability for the system to be easily updated, maintained, and adapted to changing requirements.
- Usability: the ability for the system to be easy to use, understand, and navigate for users.
- Compatibility: the ability for the system to be compatible with different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
- Extensibility: the ability for the system to be easily extended or integrated with other systems or applications.
